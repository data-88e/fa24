Iâ€™m a rising third-year undergraduate student majoring in computer science, and I'm interested in applying data science to lots of areas of study, such as public policy, urban planning, and of course, economics. Outside of academics, I enjoy cycling, repairing bikes, playing music, and learning languages, among other things. Feel free to reach out!
